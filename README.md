screenlapse
===========
0.0.0

A really simple command line tool for generating time lapse videos of your desktop.

This will create a directory "~/screencaps" if it does not exist, then save a sequence of png files in that directory named "screenXXXXXXXXXX.png", starting with "screen0000000000.png" and incrementing the number each captured frame. It will take
a new screenshot every second.

Later version will have command line arguments allowing you to configure the screenshot name, frequency, directory and so on.
